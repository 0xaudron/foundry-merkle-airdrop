## Merkle Airdrop

A simple and efficient Merkle Airdrop contract built using **Solidity**. This contract allows you to distribute tokens to multiple addresses in a trustless and secure manner using a Merkle tree structure.

## Overview

Merkle Airdrop is designed to streamline the process of airdropping tokens to a large number of recipients. Instead of sending tokens to each address individually, which can be costly and inefficient, the Merkle Airdrop contract uses a **Merkle tree** to verify the eligibility of participants in a gas-efficient way.
